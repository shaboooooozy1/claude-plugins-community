# default-strict entry WITH a manifest bumps unchanged (byte-identical default).

# Unlike test-bump.sh (which is network/gh/claude-free because every fixture
# short-circuits before `git ls-remote`), this test must drive bump.sh THROUGH the
# clone → resolve_external_manifest → validate → per-entry commit+PR path. It does
# so hermetically with PATH-shim `git`/`claude`/`gh`/`timeout` executables whose
# DEFAULT case fails closed (exit 1, never the real binary) — so a missing case is
# a loud test failure, never a live API call. It sources the REAL
# validate-plugins/lib/common.sh so the actual resolve_external_manifest is exercised.
#
# Runs in pr-mode: per-entry — the mode claude-plugins-community's nightly uses.
# Runs identically on macOS bash 3.2 and Linux bash 5.x (no bash-4 features, shims
